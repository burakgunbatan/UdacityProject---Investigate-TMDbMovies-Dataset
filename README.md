## Introduction  
I decided to select the TMDb (The Movies Database) data in order to complete my second project of "Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree program".
Dataset contains information about 10 thousand movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb).

**Important Note:**
When i was searching, i came across with similar projects which were completed by different persons.  
There were 5 different projects which are defined by Udacity Nanodegree Analyst Program.  
I made a double check in order to ask different questions and create different codes to seperate my analysis and written codes.  
I will suggest Udacity team in order to give us more different projects or giving different project datas for every different course.  

**Questions that i plan on exploring over the project from this dataset**. 

1.Best movie which has highest profit  
2.Worst movie which has lowest profit  
3.Movies which have largest and lowest budgets  
4.Movies which have high and low earned revenues  
5.Movies which are longest and shortest runtime values  
6.Average runtime of all the movies  
7.In which year we had most number of profitable movies  
8.Successful genres  
9.Best 5 Casts & Actors  
10.Average profit  
11.Average duration of the movies
